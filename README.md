# Daily-Diet-API

This repository is for a challenge provided by ROCKETSEAT to develop a daily diet tracking API, where I implemented the full CRUD functionality for managing diets, connected to a MySQL database. I also added user creation, login, and logout features.

Only logged-in users can access the /meals route and have the ability to create, view, edit, and delete registered diets.
